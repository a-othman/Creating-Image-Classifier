# Image Classifier
### In this project, I have built an image using CNN implemented using Pytorch to recognize different species of flowers. The model has been trained on over 6500 images and reached an accuracy of 83%.
### The project juypter notebook shows a step by step of for the entire project from data preparaton, to model building, training and finally evaluating the model.
### I have created a python app, train.py, that can be used for trainging for experimentation.
### I have created another python app, test.py, that can be used for testing one you have the model parameters created.
